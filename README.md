# Convert-Celsius-to-Fahrenheit
In this project I built a simple machine learning model using TensorFlow to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The objective is to predict the value of one variable Y based on another variable X.
Here Y is the unknown temperature in Fahreneit and X is the temperature in Celsius.
Basically, I have implemented regression in this project.
